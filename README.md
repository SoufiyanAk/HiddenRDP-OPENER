- Deploys modified `termsrv.dll` (if available)

### 2. **Rollback/Uninstall**
- Removes the temporary administrative account
- Disables RDP connections
- Restores original system files from backups
- Cleans up registry modifications
- Maintains system integrity

### 3. **View Status**
- Shows current RDP configuration status
- Lists existing temporary accounts

## üîß Installation & Usage

### Step 1: Prepare Files
1. Download `RDPScript.bat` and `termsrv.dll` (if needed)
2. Place both files in the same directory on the target system
3. Right-click on `RDPScript.bat` and select "Run as Administrator"

### Step 2: Configure Settings (Optional)
Before running, you can customize these variables in the script:
```batch
SET TEMP_USER=RDPTempAdmin          # Change username
SET TEMP_PASSWORD=#SecureTempPwd123! # Change password (IMPORTANT!)
```

### Step 3: Run the Script
1. Execute `RDPScript.bat` as Administrator
2. Select option [1] to install RDP configuration
3. Follow the on-screen prompts
4. **Important**: Change the temporary password immediately after installation

---

## üîÑ Rollback Process

To completely remove all changes:
1. Run `RDPScript.bat` as Administrator
2. Select option [2] for rollback
3. Confirm the rollback when prompted
4. The script will automatically:
   - Remove temporary accounts
   - Disable RDP connections
   - Restore original files
   - Clean registry entries

## üìä Status Monitoring

Use option [3] to check:
- Current RDP enable/disable status
- Temporary account existence
- Available backup files
- System configuration overview

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Best Practices:
- **Change default passwords immediately** after installation
- **Use strong, unique passwords** for temporary accounts
- **Remove temporary accounts** when no longer needed
- **Run rollback** to clean up when finished
- **Monitor system logs** for any unusual activity

### Default Credentials (CHANGE THESE!):
- Username: `RDPTempAdmin`
- Password: `#SecureTempPwd123!`

## üìù Logging & Backups

The script creates several backup and log files:

### Log Files:
- `C:\RDP_Config_YYYYMMDD.log` - Operation logs

### Backup Files:
- `C:\Windows_System32_Backup_HHMMSS\` - System file backups
- `C:\RDP_Registry_Backup_YYYYMMDD.reg` - Registry backups

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Access Denied" Error:**
- Ensure you're running as Administrator
- Check Windows UAC settings

**DLL Deployment Failed:**
- Verify `termsrv.dll` exists in the same directory
- Check file permissions
- Ensure no antivirus interference

**User Account Creation Failed:**
- Check password complexity requirements
- Verify account naming conventions
- Review local security policies

**Rollback Issues:**
- Ensure backup files exist before rolling back
- Run as Administrator
- Check log files for specific errors
